# Team 13 Progress Report (Rohde and Schwarz)
*Jan 24th to Jan 31st, 2020*

## Collective Team Progress
### Had Initial Meeting with Rohde and Schwarz Contacts Mark Beck and Radu Fetche
- They are requesting to begin research on background of Varactor loaded T-lines
- Main goal is to create a proof of concept for the creation of these networks by descriptive modeling of device behaivour and possibly construction of scaled models.
- Set up tentative meetings for wedensdays at 2:00pm every other week starting on Feb 12,2020
- Were asked to inquire about what software and labs we have access to. (Were specifically curious to see if we were able to access TeraHertz Lab and software such as Momentum or other modeling software.)
- Other main project motivation is to decrease power demands for network for as wide a bandwidth as possible. (Extend Sinc Function Side Lobes from S-Parameters)


### Began reading and taking notes on the following Articles/Papers for background
-  [Varactor-Loaded Transmission-Line Phase shifter at C-Band Using Lumped Elements](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1193122)
- [Ultra Compact, Low Loss, Varactor Tuned Phase Shifter MMIC at C-Band](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/915615)
-  [Distributed Analog Phase Shifters with Low Insertion Loss](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/788612)
-  [Design Technique for Varactor Analog Phase Shifters with Equalized Losses](http://www.jpier.org/PIERC/pierc86/01.18060504.pdf)
