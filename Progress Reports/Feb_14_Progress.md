# Team 13 Progress Report (Rohde and Schwarz)
*Feb 7th to Feb 14th, 2020*

## Collective Team Progress
We met with you, our advisor about possible routes for protoyping the NLTL technology and started getting materials and components. We arrived on Wednesday for our meeting with Rohde and Schwarz but unfortunately they forgot to make a standing appointment for the proposal and we failed to properly confirm the appointment  before going down. We learned to always put things in writing and to send reminders in order to avoid this in the future. We have rescheduled our proposal for **Wednesday, Feb 26th at 2:00pm**. If you are able to make this meeting, that would be great, but understand if this doesn't work with your schedule. We have also supplied them with digital copies of both the presentation we approved on monday as well as the slides for our presentation for them to markup and supply with feedback during our next meeting.
